# Iago Deluxe - Windows 2000 Edition

## ❌ Not Implemented

Due to significant technical challenges, a native Windows 2000 version of Iago Deluxe has not been created.

## 🚫 Technical Challenges

### Operating System Compatibility
- **Windows 2000** reached end-of-life in 2010
- **Python support**: Modern Python versions (3.6+) don't support Windows 2000
- **Pygame compatibility**: Current Pygame versions require Windows XP minimum

### Development Environment Issues
- **Toolchain limitations**: Modern development tools don't target Windows 2000
- **Security constraints**: Windows 2000 lacks modern security features required by current software
- **Hardware requirements**: Windows 2000 systems lack the processing power for modern applications

### Game Mode Implementation
- **AI complexity**: Even basic AI algorithms would be too resource-intensive for Windows 2000 hardware
- **Multi-threading**: Required for smooth computer vs computer gameplay, not well supported
- **Memory constraints**: Limited RAM on Windows 2000 systems would cause performance issues

## 💡 Alternative Solutions

### Web Version (Recommended)
The **web browser version** now includes all requested game modes:
- ✅ **Human vs Human** - Traditional 2-player gameplay
- ✅ **Human vs Computer** - Play against AI with 3 difficulty levels
- ✅ **Computer vs Computer** - Watch AI battles with adjustable difficulty
- ✅ **Cross-platform** - Works on any OS with a web browser
- ✅ **No installation** - Runs directly in browsers

### Virtualization
For Windows 2000 enthusiasts:
1. Use virtualization software (VirtualBox, VMware)
2. Install Windows 2000 in a virtual machine
3. Run the original desktop version of Iago Deluxe
4. All game modes available in the full desktop application

### Legacy System Support
If Windows 2000 support is absolutely required:
- Consider Windows XP as minimum target (still challenging)
- Accept limited functionality and no AI opponents
- Use extremely old Python/Pygame versions (not recommended due to security)

## 🎮 Game Modes Available in Web Version

| Mode | Description | AI Difficulty |
|------|-------------|---------------|
| Human vs Human | 2-player local gameplay | N/A |
| Human vs Computer | Player vs AI opponent | Easy/Medium/Hard |
| Computer vs Computer | AI vs AI demonstration | Easy/Medium/Hard |

## 📋 Recommendation

**Use the web version** for the best experience with all game modes. The desktop version already provides excellent performance on modern Windows systems (7+).
